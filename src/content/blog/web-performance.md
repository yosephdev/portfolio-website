content: "# Web Performance Optimization Techniques\n\nIn today's fast-paced digital world, users expect websites to load quickly and perform smoothly. Let's explore some key techniques for optimizing web performance.\n\n## Image Optimization\n\nImages often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a webpage. Optimize them by:\n\n- Using modern formats like WebP or AVIF\n- Implementing responsive images with srcset\n- Lazy loading images below the fold\n- Compressing images without significant quality loss\n\n```html\n<img src=\"small.jpg\"\n     srcset=\"medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w\"\n     sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, (max-width: 1500px) 50vw, 30vw\"\n     loading=\"lazy\"\n     alt=\"Optimized responsive image\">\n```\n\n## Code Splitting\n\nDon't make users download code they don't need immediately.\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of importing the entire library\n// import { Button, TextField, Dialog } from 'some-ui-library';\n\n// Import only what you need\nimport Button from 'some-ui-library/Button';\nimport TextField from 'some-ui-library/TextField';\n```\n\nIn React applications, use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n\nconst ExpensiveComponent = lazy(() => import('./ExpensiveComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n      <ExpensiveComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical CSS\n\nInline critical styles in the head of your document to avoid render-blocking CSS:\n\n```html\n<head>\n  <style>\n    /* Critical styles needed for above-the-fold content */\n    .header { ... }\n    .hero { ... }\n  </style>\n  \n  <!-- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously -->\n  <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"styles.css\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n</head>\n```\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nImplement effective caching with appropriate cache-control headers:\n\n```\nCache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable  // For versioned assets\nCache-Control: no-cache                      // For HTML documents\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPerformance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly audit your website's performance using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest, and make incremental improvements based on the results. Remember that even small optimizations can lead to significant improvements in user experience and conversion rates."
