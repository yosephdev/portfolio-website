After years of writing Python code and reviewing others' work, I've compiled what I consider essential best practices for writing clean, maintainable Python code. These guidelines have helped me throughout my career and might help you too.



## Follow the Zen of Python

The Zen of Python, accessible via `import this` in any Python interpreter, offers guiding principles for writing good Python code:



```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it's a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```



## Use Virtual Environments

Always use virtual environments to isolate dependencies for different projects:



```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate it
source myenv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Track dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```



## Follow PEP 8

PEP 8 is the style guide for Python code. Some key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Limit lines to 79 characters for code, 72 for comments
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes
- Use spaces around operators and after commas



Tools like `flake8` or `black` can help enforce these standards:



```bash
pip install flake8 black
flake8 your_file.py
black your_file.py
```



## Write Docstrings

Document your code with docstrings. I prefer Google style docstrings for their readability:



```python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Calculate the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of integers or floats.
        
    Returns:
        float: The arithmetic mean.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate mean of empty list")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```



## Use Type Hints

Type hints make your code more readable and allow for static type checking:



```python
def greet(name: str, age: int = 30) -> str:
    """Return a greeting message.
    
    Args:
        name: The person's name
        age: The person's age, defaults to 30
        
    Returns:
        A greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!"
```



Use `mypy` to check your type hints:



```bash
pip install mypy
mypy your_file.py
```



## Use Context Managers

For resource management, context managers (using `with` statements) ensure proper cleanup:



```python
# Good - file will be closed automatically
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# Not as good - you must remember to close the file
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()
```



## Beware of Mutable Default Arguments

A classic Python pitfall:



```python
# Bad - the list is created once at function definition
def append_to(element, to=[]):
    to.append(element)
    return to

# Good - create a new list each time
def append_to(element, to=None):
    if to is None:
        to = []
    to.append(element)
    return to
```



## Use List Comprehensions Judiciously

List comprehensions can make code concise, but overly complex ones hurt readability:



```python
# Good - simple and readable
squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]

# Too complex - better to use a loop
matrix = [[i*j for j in range(10)] for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
```



## Exception Handling

Be specific about the exceptions you catch:



```python
# Bad - catches everything, even KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit
try:
    do_something()
except:
    handle_error()

# Good - only catches specific exceptions
try:
    do_something()
except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    handle_error(e)
```



## Testing

Write tests for your code using a framework like `pytest`:



```python
# test_calculator.py
import pytest
from calculator import add

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2
```



Run tests with:



```bash
pytest
```



## Package Structure

Organize your code properly:



```
my_package/
│
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
├── module2.py
│
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   └── test_module2.py
│
├── README.md
├── setup.py
└── requirements.txt
```



## Conclusion

These practices have helped me write better Python code throughout my career. They emphasize readability, maintainability, and robustness - values that are especially important in team environments and long-lived projects.

Remember, the goal isn't to follow rules blindly but to write code that's easy to understand, debug, and extend. As you gain experience, you'll develop your own sense of what works best, but these guidelines provide a solid foundation.
